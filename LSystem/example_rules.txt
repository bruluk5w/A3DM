Explanation:
- X and F are variables and advance the drawing by 1.
- [ and ] push and pop respectively the drawing state
- + and - rotate the next segment around the x-axis (positive direction and negative direction respectively)
- * and / rotate the next segment around the z-axis (positive direction and negative direction respectively)
- +-*/ accept a positive float parameter: e.g.: *(1.5). The ui allows to define a standard rotation value for each 
rotational axis. The optional parameters on the the rotation operators scale their respective default value: -(0.5)
means: rotate half the default angle around the negative x-axis.

These are some examples:

weed 1
Axiom: X
Rules:
F -> FF
X -> F-[[X]+X]+F[-X]+FX

weed 2
Axiom: X
Rules:
F -> FF
X -> F-[[X]+X]+F[+FX]-X

weed 2 (with parameter)
Axiom: X
Rules:
F -> FF
X -> F-[[X]+(2)X]+F[+FX]-(2)X

weed 2 3d 
Axiom: X
Rules:
F -> FF
X -> F-[[X]+*(0.5)X]+F[+/FX]-(1)X
